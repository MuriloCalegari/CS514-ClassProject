# CS514-ClassProject

### Onboarding

Run the ./setup.sh file to install the necessary dependencies.

```
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

There's a launch.json configuration to run the project test.
Alternatively, you may run the ns3 file directly with:

```
cd ./ns-allinone-3.43/ns-3.43
./ns3 run adaptive-tcp-test
```
